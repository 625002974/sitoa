ICE Particles don't respect orientation since Softimage 2011.5

CQuaternion and CQuaternionf internal representation changed.
As stated by halfdan.
"A fix was made in Sidecar (2011.5) to fix the order of the CQuaternion data
 members, because it was different from the internal quaternion class."

This was breaking our ICE code. See Ticket #756
