Shader compounds don't work when exposed connections are renamed

When exposing various parameters on a shader from within a compound the compound
only works if the exposed connection is named the same as the port it's plugged
into, if you for example expose the parameter "Kd" in the standard shader and 
leave the name of the connection to "Kd" it works but as soon as you rename the
connection to something ele the output becomes black.
