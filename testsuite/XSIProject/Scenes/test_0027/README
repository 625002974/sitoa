A camera named RightCamera, doesn't render with the correct position

When a camera is named RightCamera, it doesn't render with the correct positioning.
It happens the same with the names FrontCamera, TopCamera.
The reasoning behind this is that there is some hardcoded code that was repositioning cameras with that name
to avoid a glitch related to ticket #493
