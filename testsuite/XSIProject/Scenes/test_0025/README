ICE Strand Color is broken in Softimage 2010 + SP1. 

It only works in the first strand, the rest render black.
This is related to a bug in the XSI SDK in SP1. If the memory for the subarray 
is assigned prior to the 2d array, it works fine. The reason is a low level 
memory copy operation to access sub arrays only works that way. Ticket #554
