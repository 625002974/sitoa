Implementation of the evaluation of parameters in txt2d-gradient_v2

txt_gradient shader was not evaluating the parameters, only its value with AiNodeGet* in node_initialize.
If we attach nodes to those params it won't work as expected. This will allow to plug textures/shaders into 
the different gradient positions
